well i am doing this to write my experiecne while developing and learing(and i am sorry about the spellings and my broken grammers).
at first i thought of using raw golang, but then i saw an article using gin and it's simplicity got me 
to use gin...after goorila i am using gin and so far it's amazing (dont have to explicitly meniton manythings)

well then i connected to sql (i don't why i choose sql but i wanted to work on sql db and maybe i could have choose 
postgree but it is how it is), writted my few routes and evertime you create a route handler function, we do have to start with 
providing the context to the handler. Also yeah i wanted to perform the transctional queries which actully pushed me 
to create this project. 

Along the way, figuring out the logic and putting comments to remember and TODO, you will find them if reading in between..
Testing each route throuh postman then decided to add frontend, choosing react was a good choice so far (i always though go goes with HTMX/HTML
which i hated to write after moving to reactjs)

Testing the frontend req through fetch and then learning react-query(i knew it but havnt worked on it, so was the time)..
and it was good to use and i still doubt the advantage of using react-query bcz i though it has defualt caching mech with the key
but it was not, actully have to store in the localStorage(client's browser max:5-10MB) and for GET req it is simple but for POST req 
at first glace it was overwhelming seeing so much addition to this(by seeing code example in docs i didnt even think of writing my POST req using 
useMutation i.e react-query), maybe later i would try to understand and write that

today let's try to work on middleware and login user(btw i am liking this, writing about what i am doing, ps i know no one will ever read this shit)
you have to pass this everytime:
headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`   // This is what c.GetHeader() reads!
  },
till now working: singin, login...
well for now i was creating the protect route for frotnend and to get the token from the localStorage, could use useState & useEffecr but for every page 
i have to do this and i have worked prev with authContext of react hook but you know, let's explore zustand (famous status management solution).

also zustand is pretty simple, actully i dont have to say localStorage.setItem to do, it does this for me..

well idk if I am starting it back correctly, lastly ended up with removing the cache from localStorage through react query and learned about the staletime 
and cachetime...how they works and default config... Then I worked on the frontend, fetching the user and switching back to backend to make organisation 
as a different schema...like login as user ( who can register for events ) and login as organisation ( who can publish events) and implemented it by making 
new middle ware for organisational routes having different secret key and in frontend modified old auth.js, which is break down into userAuth and orgAuth 
both having different token and login/logout functionality for best abstraction...I can do by assigning roles but let's try this...was successfully completed 
to login the organisation and then redirect to the dashboard(ps thinking about the role and different auth management with zustand was time taking but was fun). 
also though of implementing the follow/unfollow for updates and notification about events to user....where I added a Boolean flag along with userid and orgid
i.e. subscribed which will help in toggling and not deleting the entry everytime (could batch and delete) bcz every time deleting a single entry will 
rebalance the b+tree and toggling will help
